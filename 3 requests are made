3 requests are made

(1) When user clicks Convert button
(2) When file has uploaded
(3) When file has converted

In Python code we are trying to access request.form['is_convert_clicked']

This works fine for request (1) because we are sending this value over.

But it crashes when request (2) is received because it tries to access request.form['is_convert_clicked'] and it's non-existent.

Summary:
can't do request.form['blah'] if blah doesn't actually exist.
need to check it exists first with:

'blah' in request.form and request.form['blah'] == ...
