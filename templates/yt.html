        <p> It may seem like nothing is happening after you click on the appropriate button, but the file is being downloaded to the server. How long this will take depends on the length of the video. For short videos such as music videos, this won't take long. On completion, the server will send the file to your browser and one of two things will happen: <p>
        <p>[A] Your browser will start downloading the file automatically.<p>
        <p>[B] Your browser will ask if you want to download the file.</p>
        <i>If using an iOS device, select "Download Video [iOS]" or "Download as an MP3 file".</i>
